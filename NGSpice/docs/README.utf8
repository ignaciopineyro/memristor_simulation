use utf-8 for encoding of strings, this enables UNICODE
international characters sets (of nearly any language)
in plot titles and labels, file and folder names.

Windows uses utf-16 and conversion functions between utf-8
and utf-16, if access to Windows API functions is needed.
A special fopen has been defined.

In addition, plot labels on the y axis now are placed
vertically, 90Â°, by using the Windows API or the Linux Xft library.

Postscript plotting uses only a UNICODE subset, namely
ISO-8859-1/ISO-8859-15, that allows extended ascii.

Better looking fonts are now used for labeling the axes.

Variables xbrushwidth and xgridwidth (to be set e.g. in
.spiceinit or directly before a plot command) allow setting 
separately the linewidths of the graph (xbrushwidth) and 
the grid (xgridwidth).

Slight modification of the Windows GUI string window to
enhance readability.

Windows GUI is now more responsive during lengthy op
calculations.

UNICODE in Gnuplot and (limited) in Postscript are supported.
You will need to download and install gnuplot and a PS viewer
(e.g. ghostscript, gv or others).

Input files to ngspice now have to be utf-8 encoded. ANSI 
encoded files will fail (Notepad++ on Windows allows a simple
conversion). For an ANSI version of ngspice you have to
compile it with the configure flag --disable-utf8.
